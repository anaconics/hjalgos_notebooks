# Algorithmic Trading Script

This script is designed to place orders for financial instruments using the Kite Connect API. It retrieves historical data for a particular instrument and calculates various values such as the pivot price, the number of steps, and the difference in price and quantity between each trade. Based on these values and user-specified parameters, it places orders according to a specified strategy.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- kiteconnect

## Usage

1. Make sure you have installed the required dependencies.
2. Fill in the required values in the "Update this part only" section of the script. This includes the `one_dollar_margin`, `per_order_quant`, `initial_difference`, `order_type`, `symbol_ip`, `inst_token`, `moving_pivot_on`, `stoploss_on`, and `days_ago_data` variables.
3. Run the script using `python script.py`.

## Notes

- The `auto_login()` function in the `login` module is currently commented out. To use the script, you will need to implement this function or provide an alternative way to authenticate with the Kite Connect API.
- The script has been tested with the `USDINR20OCTFUT` symbol, but it should work with other symbols as well. You will need to set the `symbol_ip` and `inst_token` variables accordingly.
- The `stoploss_on` feature is currently not implemented and will have no effect on the script.
- The `moving_pivot_on` feature is currently not implemented and will have no effect on the script.
